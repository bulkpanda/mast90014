**Welcome to MAST 90014 - Optimisation for Industry.**

In MAST 90014, we present the core ideas of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), a powerful optimisation framework to solve optimisation problems in Industry and Public Decision Making.

We will place a strong focus on modelling. The first and foremost goal of this subject is to provide students with the ability to understand an optimisation problem and represent it as a mathematical model using linear constraints on continuous and discrete variables.

The use of linear constraints allows us to solve the modelled problems using the MIP framework. In this subject, students will learn how to use state-of-the-art mathematical programming solvers to obtain solutions for the developed models. They will also understand the algorithms used by these solvers and learn how to extend their capabilities using decomposition methods.
